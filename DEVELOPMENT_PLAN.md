# DealPig Development Plan

This document outlines the planned development roadmap, testing strategy, and maintenance practices for the DealPig platform.

## Current Issues

1. **Testing Framework Issues**:
   - ✅ Missing dependency `@testing-library/dom` has been installed, but tests still need fixes
   - ✅ Database test mocks don't match actual function signatures - Fixed with proper mock implementation
   - ✅ Email sending tests are failing due to incorrect mocking of Gmail API - Fixed with comprehensive Gmail API mocking
   - ✅ Document generation tests failing due to docx.Header constructor issues - Fixed with proper docx library mocking

2. **React Version Compatibility**:
   - The `react-draft-wysiwyg` package is not compatible with React 19
   - Currently bypassing with `--legacy-peer-deps` but needs a permanent solution

3. **Security Issues**:
   - npm audit shows vulnerabilities that need to be addressed

## Short-term Improvements (1-3 months)

1. **Fix Testing Framework**:
   - ✅ Update test mocks to match actual function signatures
   - ✅ Implement proper mocking for Gmail API and docx library
   - Aim for >80% test coverage

2. **Security Hardening**:
   - Address npm vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper CSRF protection
   - Add rate limiting to API endpoints
   - Complete security audit

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Mobile responsiveness improvements
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Error message standardization

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use React Query for data fetching
   - Optimize bundle size

## Mid-term Improvements (3-6 months)

1. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - ✅ Advanced search and filtering - Implemented in LeadsTable with status and email status filters
   - ❌ Bulk actions for leads - Not yet implemented
   - ✅ Custom document templates - Implemented with template selection and editing in DocumentPreview
   - ❌ Email scheduling - Not yet implemented
   - ❌ Pipeline visualization - Not yet implemented

2. **Technical Debt**:
   - ❌ Replace `react-draft-wysiwyg` with React 19 compatible editor - Still using legacy peer deps
   - ❌ Migrate to typed API endpoints with tRPC - Not yet implemented
   - ✅ Component library standardization - Consistently using NextUI/HeroUI components
   - ✅ Extract shared logic to custom hooks - Implemented hooks for common functionality

3. **Integration**:
   - Add Google Calendar integration
   - Enable CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot)
   - Property data API integration

## Long-term Vision (6-12 months)

1. **Platform Expansion**:
   - Mobile application
   - Chrome extension
   - Offline capabilities
   - Multi-language support

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - AI-powered deal analysis
   - Automated comps pulling
   - Document OCR and parsing
   - Advanced analytics and reporting
   - Team collaboration features

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Microservices architecture
   - Serverless functions
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Self-hosted option

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Component Tests**: Test individual React components in isolation
- **Function Tests**: Test utility functions and helpers
- **Hook Tests**: Test custom React hooks

### Integration Tests
- **API Tests**: Ensure API endpoints work correctly
- **Form Tests**: Test form submissions and validation
- **State Management Tests**: Ensure state changes correctly

### End-to-End Tests
- Implement Cypress for key user journeys
- Test authentication flow
- Test lead management flow
- Test document generation and email sending

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with k6
- Lighthouse scores monitoring
- Bundle size monitoring

## Deployment Pipeline

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local development
   - Feature branches

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Automated tests run
   - Integration testing
   - Staging environment

3. **Production Environment**
   - Vercel production deployment
   - Feature flags for controlled rollout
   - Monitoring and alerting

## Maintenance Practices

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Weekly automated dependency updates
   - Security patches applied immediately
   - Major version upgrades planned quarterly

2. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint and Prettier for code style
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - PR templates and reviews

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep README and API documentation up-to-date
   - Internal documentation for development processes
   - Code comments for complex logic

4. **Monitoring**
   - Error tracking with Sentry
   - Performance monitoring
   - User analytics

## Team Organization

1. **Roles**
   - Frontend Developer(s)
   - Backend Developer(s)
   - DevOps Engineer
   - Product Manager
   - QA Engineer

2. **Communication**
   - Weekly sprint planning
   - Daily standups
   - Sprint retrospectives
   - Documentation in GitHub wiki

## Conclusion

This development plan is a living document and should be updated as the project evolves. The focus should be on maintaining a high-quality, secure, and maintainable codebase while continuously delivering value to users.
