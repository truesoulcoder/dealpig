**Creating development plan**

Okay, I need to outline a plan for building a system that polls the Zillow API daily for property listings over 90 days on the market. First, I'll store those listings in a database, carefully parsing relevant data for the offer calculations. Then, I’ll ensure the leads get sent to agents, who’ll draft the emails with purchase offers. I also need to track email responses (opens, bounces, replies) and send those data to update real-time analytics. The system should keep KPIs in an archive table, and notify investors when leads are accepted.

**Creating development plan**

I’m thinking about how to structure a development plan with phases, tasks, architecture, and tech. It’s important to stay aligned with the user preferences: clever humor, forward-thinking, and some healthy skepticism about mainstream news. I'll reference legal definitions when needed — let’s make sure we get the “offer” or “contract” terms from Black’s Law dictionary for clarity, especially if we're dealing with contracts. The plan will involve various microservices, APIs (like Zillow or SendGrid), and analytics tools like Chart.js, all tied together with real-time data and message queues. Let’s get the specifics on tech needs, like the Zillow API.

**Crafting plan for lead system**

The task is clear: I don't need to parse the diagram, just focus on the description. I’ll start by understanding the different flows: lead, offer, response, and hot lead. My next step is to create a plan that outlines each flow. I’ll make sure to reference important sources like the Zillow API docs. To get accurate details, I’ll search for terms like "Zillow API days on market" and confirm everything before putting the plan together.

**Crafting development plan**

I’ll focus on understanding the different flows: lead data, offers, responses, and hot leads. The next step is to create a development plan based on these, making sure to refer to Zillow API docs, SendGrid event webhooks, Gmail API, and email tracking methods. The plan will include phases like data ingestion, processing, distribution, outreach, tracking, analytics, and investor alerting. I’ll also mention key tech stack suggestions and legal terms like "offer" or "contract" when necessary, using Black’s Law definitions.

**Crafting plan for development**

I’ll need to explain that the "purchase offer" aligns with contract law's definition of "offer"—a formal invitation to enter into an agreement. For this task, no coding tools are necessary yet, but a little clever humor can help make the response engaging. The plan will showcase phases like data ingestion (Zillow API), offer generation, lead distribution, and email drafting. Key elements include real-time data pull, using a formula for determining offers, connecting agents with leads, and sending emails instantly through a secure process.

### 1  |  Phase‑by‑Phase Roadmap (12‑week agile sprint)

1. **Foundations (Week 1‑2)**

   * Repo setup, CI/CD, IaC (Pulumi).
   * Provision Postgres, Redis, S3, Kubernetes namespace.

2. **Zillow Poller MVP (Week 2‑3)**

   * OAuth handshake & rate‑limit strategy.
   * Filter `daysOnMarket > 90`, persist rows.
   * Unit tests w/ mocked Zillow JSON.

3. **Offer Engine + LOI Generator (Week 3‑4)**

   * ARV logic stub (later swap‑in ML comps).
   * Docupilot template merge.
   * Store LOI S3 URL in `offers` table.

4. **Agent Distribution & Portal (Week 4‑5)**

   * Redis streams topic `leads.new`.
   * React portal for agents (login, queue, “Send Offer” button).
   * Quota/round‑robin algorithm toggled via feature flag.

5. **Email Orchestrator (Week 5‑6)**

   * Gmail API draft/send w/ attachment & pixel `<img src="https://track.dealpig.io/open/{uuid}.png" …>`
   * Rotate sender display names (“Buyer Desk”, etc.).
   * DKIM/SPF checks ‑ avoid spam hell.

6. **Event Listener & Tracking (Week 6‑7)**

   * Pixel endpoint logs OPEN.
   * Gmail webhook polls `messages:list` every 90 sec for REPLY, parses thread id.
   * Soft/hard bounce captured via SendGrid SMPT 550 codes ([docs.sendgrid.com](https://docs.sendgrid.com/apireference?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

7. **Analytics & KPI Dashboard (Week 7‑8)**

   * Timescale hypertable `email_events`.
   * Live widgets: sent, open‑rate, reply‑rate, bounce‑rate, alias drill‑down.
   * Nightly cron rolls metrics into `kpi_archive`.

8. **Hot Lead Distribution to Investors (Week 8‑9)**

   * NLP classifier (rule‑based to start) tags positive replies → enqueue.
   * Investor mobile PWA; push notification with Stripe pay‑link (15‑min lock).
   * Payment webhook flips `lead_status = SOLD`.

9. **Hardening & Edge‑Cases (Week 9‑10)**

   * Retry & dead‑letter queues.
   * Rate‑limit Gmail 100 msgs/day/alias (your 10‑alias spec).
   * Privacy & logging (GDPR/CCPA audit log).

10. **Load Testing + Monitoring (Week 10‑11)**

    * K6 scripts: 5k listings, 1k email events/min.
    * Grafana dashboards; PagerDuty on 5xx > 1%.

11. **UAT & Launch (Week 12)**

    * Pilot with 50 real leads.
    * Debrief → iterate.

### 2  |  Database Sketch (Postgres)

```sql
tables:
  properties(id PK, zpid, address, dom, list_price, raw_json)
  offers(id PK, property_id FK, cash_offer, loi_url, status enum)
  agents(id PK, name, quota_daily)
  agent_leads(id PK, property_id FK, agent_id FK, assigned_at)
  email_events(id PK, agent_lead_id FK, event_type enum, timestamp, meta jsonb)
  investors(id PK, name, stripe_customer)
  hot_leads(id PK, property_id FK, investor_id FK, price, status, claimed_at)
  kpi_archive(date, sent_cnt, open_cnt, reply_cnt, bounces_soft, bounces_hard)
```

---

### 3  |  Key Algorithms & Formulas

* **Cash Offer**
  `offer = (ARV × 0.50) – repairs` (constant to start; later ML).
* **Distribution Weight**
  `score = (1 + reply_rate) / (1 + bounce_rate)` → higher score, more leads.
* **Investor Claim Race**
  Sorted by `claimed_at NULLS LAST, created_at ASC`, row‑lock to prevent double‑sell.

---

### 4  |  Security & Compliance Cheat‑Sheet

* **PII** encrypted at rest (AES‑256) & in transit (TLS 1.3).
* **Offer documents** watermark with UUID; revoke link if lead sold.
* **CAN‑SPAM** footer & unsubscribe link (even in transactional email – reduces spam complaints).
* **Stripe** PaymentIntent w/ `application_fee_amount` if using Connect.

---

### 5  |  Forward‑Thinking Enhancements

1. **Comps ML Model** – gradient‑boost tree using Zillow + public MLS, for tighter ARV.
2. **LLM Email Draft Assistant** – autopopulate agent email, tuned on your past 1,600 LOIs.
3. **Voice‑bot Follow‑Up** – Twilio Voice AI to call unresponsive sellers after 48 h.
4. **On‑chain Lead Provenance** – hash lead metadata to immutable ledger (prevents double‑sell disputes).

---

### 6  |  Risks & Skeptic’s Notes

* **Zillow TOS** – access conditioned on broker partnership; monitor for API deprecations ([Homepage V2](https://www.zillowgroup.com/developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Open‑rate Accuracy** – pixel blocked by privacy‑conscious recipients; treat as soft signal only ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77089925/how-to-track-read-status-for-individual-recipients-by-adding-pixel-tracking?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-email-open-tracking-quietly-took-over-the-web?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Email Deliverability** – warming schedule & domain authentication mandatory ([docs.sendgrid.com](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication?gh_jid=4483352&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Investor Payment Failures** – hold lead 10 min; auto‑release if Stripe payment\_intent fails.

---

### 7  |  Next Actions for the Week

1. Secure Zillow API partner key & confirm DOM field availability.
2. Spin up skeletal Postgres & Redis.
3. Build Zillow Poller proof‑of‑concept pulling 10 sample listings into `properties`.
4. Approve LOI Docupilot template with variable placeholders.

Pull the trigger and we’ll turn that diagram from pretty pixels into profit‑producing pipelines—without buying any snake‑oil from big‑tech hype merchants. 🐷🚀
