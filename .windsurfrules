DealPig is a single-user, super-admin-only internal control panel for the company's marketing and acquisitions department. Only Chris Phillips (chrisphillips@truesoulpartners.com) and his backup email (egoluxinvicta@gmail.com) are allowed to log in. The app is not a multi-user SaaS; all features, UI, and backend logic are designed for a single operator. Authentication is locked down to these emails via Google OAuth. All admin actions (user management, Gmail automation, SaaS provisioning, workflow triggers) are available only to the super user. Future backdoor/owner access may be added after prototype, but is not in scope now. All code is IP of the CTO and is not for mass distribution.
