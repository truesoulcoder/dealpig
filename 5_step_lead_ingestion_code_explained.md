# 5-Step Lead Ingestion Pipeline: Code Explained

This document explains, in plain English, each of the 5 steps of your lead ingestion pipeline. For every step, it cites the exact code, triggers, upload, logging, and backend automation that perform the work. Use this as a blueprint for understanding, testing, and extending your ingestion process.

## Step 1: Uploading the CSV File

**What happens?**
- The user uploads a CSV file of raw leads through the UI (Leads page).
- The file is stored in the `lead-uploads` storage bucket with a unique filename (e.g., `filename_uniquehash.csv`).

**Where is this handled in code?**
- **Frontend:** `LeadUploader.tsx` (handles file selection and upload)
- **Backend API Route:** `app/api/leads/upload/route.ts`
  - Handles the HTTP POST request from the UI.
  - Validates the CSV file.
  - Uses PapaParse to parse the CSV in-memory.
  - Uploads the file to Supabase Storage (`lead-uploads` bucket).
  - **Logging:** On success/failure, logs the result to the UI ConsoleLog and to the backend events table.
- **Metadata Registration:** `app/api/leads/register-source/route.ts`
  - After upload, this route records metadata about the file in the `lead_sources` table (including filename, upload time, user, etc.).
  - **Duplicate Prevention:** Checks for duplicate filenames to avoid overwriting.

## Step 2: Raw Lead Processing

**What happens?**
- The system prepares the `leads` table for new data by truncating (clearing) it.
- The uploaded CSV is imported directly into the `leads` table with data from the uploaded csv filling appropriate columns where values exist. If a value doesnt exist for a column, it is left empty.  
*note: not every csv file will have data for every column, so some columns will be left empty.*

**Where is this handled in code?  It's not working currently**
**So the error must be coming from logic in this section**
**Review the codebase for any errors in the raw lead processing logic and edit this section reflecting the fixes you applied**
- **SQL Script:** `data/RAW_LEAD_PROCESSING.sql`
  ```sql
  -- STEP 2: Raw Lead Processing
  INSERT INTO events (type, message, timestamp) VALUES ('info', 'Raw lead processing started', NOW());
  TRUNCATE TABLE leads;
  -- Import CSV into leads
  -- Example (PostgreSQL):
  -- \\copy leads FROM '/path/to/lead-imports/filename_uniquehash.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
  INSERT INTO events (type, message, timestamp) VALUES ('info', 'Raw lead processing completed successfully', NOW());
  ```
- **Logging:** Each major action (start, complete) is logged to the `events` table for UI visibility.
- **Backend Automation:** This script is run either by a backend job, a trigger, or manually after upload.

## Step 3: Normalization

**What happens?**
- The system normalizes the raw data from the `leads` table into a new table called `normalized_leads`.
- Only rows with valid contact names and emails are included.
- All data types are set to `TEXT` to prevent import/type errors.

**Where is this handled in code?**
- **SQL Script:** `data/NORMALIZED_LEAD_PROCESSING.sql`
  ```sql
  -- STEP 3: Normalize Lead Processing
  INSERT INTO events (type, message, timestamp) VALUES ('info', 'Normalization process started', NOW());
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS normalized_leads;
  CREATE TABLE normalized_leads (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      original_lead_id TEXT,
      contact_name TEXT,
      contact_email TEXT,
      property_address TEXT,
      property_city TEXT,
      property_state TEXT,
      property_postal_code TEXT,
      property_type TEXT,
      baths TEXT,
      beds TEXT,
      year_built TEXT,
      square_footage TEXT,
      wholesale_value TEXT,
      assessed_total TEXT,
      mls_curr_status TEXT,
      mls_curr_days_on_market TEXT
  );
  ```
- **Logging:** Normalization start is logged to `events`.

---

## Step 4: Inserting Normalized Data

**What happens?**
- The system inserts normalized rows into `normalized_leads` from the `leads` table.
- This includes mapping for multiple contacts and MLS agent data, using `UNION ALL` for each possible contact.

**Where is this handled in code?**
- **SQL Script:** (continued in `data/NORMALIZED_LEAD_PROCESSING.sql`)
  ```sql
  -- STEP 4: Insert normalized data
  INSERT INTO normalized_leads (
      original_lead_id, contact_name, contact_email,
      property_address, property_city, property_state, property_postal_code,
      property_type, baths, beds, year_built, square_footage,
      wholesale_value, assessed_total, mls_curr_status, mls_curr_days_on_market
  )
  SELECT ... FROM leads WHERE ... -- (see full script for all contact/agent mappings)
  ```
- **Filtering:** Only rows with non-empty names and emails are included.
- **Backend Automation:** This step is part of the normalization script, run after raw import.

---

## Step 5: Archiving and Cleanup

**What happens?**
- The `normalized_leads` table is renamed to an archive table with a timestamp (e.g., `normalized_20250502_134512_12345`).
- A success event is logged.
- The `leads` table is truncated again, ready for the next batch.

**Where is this handled in code?**
- **SQL Script:** (continued in `data/NORMALIZED_LEAD_PROCESSING.sql`)
  ```sql
  -- STEP 5: Archive and cleanup
  DO $$
  DECLARE
    new_name TEXT := 'normalized_' || to_char(NOW(), 'YYYYMMDD_HH24MISS') || '_' || floor(random()*100000)::TEXT;
  BEGIN
    EXECUTE format('ALTER TABLE normalized_leads RENAME TO %I', new_name);
  END $$;
  INSERT INTO events (type, message, timestamp) VALUES ('info', 'Normalization and archiving completed successfully', NOW());
  TRUNCATE TABLE leads;
  ```
- **Logging:** Archive and cleanup are logged to `events` for UI and auditing.
- **Automation:** This is the final part of the normalization script.

---

## Other Key Automation & Logging

- **UI ConsoleLog:** Displays real-time progress/status by reading from the `events` table.
- **File Explorer:** Shows uploaded files from the `lead-imports` bucket.
- **Leads Table:** Shows ingested leads from the `leads` or most recent normalized table.
- **Backend Automation:** Scripts can be triggered by backend jobs, API calls, or manually, depending on your orchestration preference.
